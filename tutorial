How to make your own item shop!

1: Go to item shop template in this repo
2: Go to https://fortnite.gg and type in the cosmetic you want to put in that shop space
3: Find the id of the cosmetic, it will look something like: CID_495_Athena_Commando_F_MechPilotShark
4: Go back to the template and copy and paste the contents into a notepad document
5: Find the place you want to put your cosmetic (For instance the first slot in featured)
6: Where it says "itemGrants": ["AthenaCharacter:cid_001_athena_commando_m_default"], replace the cid_001_athena_commando_m_default or whatever character is in the template with your id
7: Before you enter your id, make sure that the template looks like this per cosmetic:
Skin : ["AthenaCharacter:yourskin"]
Emote : ["AthenaDance:youremote"]
Pickaxe : ["AthenaPickaxe:yourpickaxe"]
Back Bling : ["AthenaBackpack:yourbackbling"]
Wrap : ["AthenaItemWrap:yourwrap"]
8: Thats pretty much it! Best shops will be used in Shadow's daily rotating item shop on release and you will get all the skins from the shops
